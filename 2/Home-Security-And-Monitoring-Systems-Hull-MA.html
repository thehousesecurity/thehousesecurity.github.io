<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching.

Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
