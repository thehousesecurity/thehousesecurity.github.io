<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send smartphone notifies with that info when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
