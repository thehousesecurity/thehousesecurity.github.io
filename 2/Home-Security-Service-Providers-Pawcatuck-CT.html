<p>I have this camera linked to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without problem. The IR lights in the evening are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
