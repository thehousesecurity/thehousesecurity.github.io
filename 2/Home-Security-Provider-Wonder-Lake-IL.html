<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our screening-- during the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We must note that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based on offered bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day.
