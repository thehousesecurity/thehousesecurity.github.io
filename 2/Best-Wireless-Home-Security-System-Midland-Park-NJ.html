<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for additional electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera independently, generally by means of 110VAC power.</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide detection. Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a gas that can be harmful to both animals and people.
