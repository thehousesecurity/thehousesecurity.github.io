<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively typical.

With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. False alarms take place.
