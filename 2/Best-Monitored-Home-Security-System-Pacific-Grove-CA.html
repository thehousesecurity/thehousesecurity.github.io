<p>This being Ring, the app is polished and expert too, and if you want to see what your camera is filming then you can get the video footage up on an Echo Show or a Fire TV gadget with an easy Alexa voice command. I hear this all the time in my everyday operations management of American Alarm Systems. If contract plans do not attract you, consider Blue by ADT, which uses DIY installation and self-monitoring.
