<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
