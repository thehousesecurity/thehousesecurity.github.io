<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you want to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the agreement.. So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no idea I was in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Actually irritating. Again the sales people, or at least mine, do not mention the 3 year dedication. I called their client service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to discuss it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the swelling sum, because obviously they auto restore you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.
