In the past, we've seen cameras as low as $45, while security systems range between $100 and $150.</p>

<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends possible offenders are less likely to devote criminal offense if they think they are being viewed or have a greater threat of being apprehended. This is also called the logical choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime avoidance method, which argues that opportunities to upset can be lowered by altering a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a transgressor being apprehended, increasing the effort to commit the crime, reducing rewards from crime commission, and decreasing justifications that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the culprit must understand the included surveillance for it to achieve its desired impact.</p>
<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, catering to sophisticated smart home fanatics or fans of a specific ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I tested, including clever things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. But the Secure is expensive, additional sensing units are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of smoke alarm or camera backups-- is likewise expensive if you do not dedicate to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>Rates-- There is no contracts with SimpliSafe. You just purchase a system to your own specification and own it. There is no service arrangement and even any requirement to buy a monitoring package. What's more, you can Do It Yourself install or use professional installation services at $199.
