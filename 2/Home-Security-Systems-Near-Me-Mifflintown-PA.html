Wyze's recently introduced Complete Motion Capture solves this issue for $1.50 per month per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly begins another, without any gaps in between.

<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).
