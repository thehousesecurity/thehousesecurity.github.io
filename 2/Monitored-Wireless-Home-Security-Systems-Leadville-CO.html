Unfortunately I purchased 4 cameras that look much like these, believing I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the exact same camera. Boy was I wrong!! These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of the box. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is truly excellent. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
<p>Think about it in this manner, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more advanced camera be sold for the low cost of forty dollars? It just does not add up. To offer such low prices, manufacturers need to cut corners, and completion result is jeopardized performance. What good is a surveillance camera that just works preferably in best conditions like brilliant sunshine? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in specific scenarios such as nanny cameras or checking in on an animal, though when wanting to gather evidence of a crime they typically lose.</p>
<p>However, multi-megapixel IP-CCTV cameras are coming on the market. Still rather pricey, however they can record video images at resolutions of 1, 2, 3, 5 and even up to 11 Mpix.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
