<p>The Wyze Cam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be an effective security choice (although we liked it as a pet cam ). It has because been improved and now equals our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and a number of smart-home combination alternatives. We appreciate that the company continues to iterate and enhance an item that costs about as much as a pizza.

<p>The majority of outdoor cameras, like the Arlo Ultra, provide motion detection with push and e-mail notifications, night vision, and cloud storage for event-triggered video, and some, like the Ring Floodlight Camera, pull double responsibility as floodlights or porch lights.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal since the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers realize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
