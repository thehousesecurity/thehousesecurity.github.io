<p>An engaging argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe subscription is that it adds individual detection, that makes for smarter smartphone alerts-- and, in some cases, fewer incorrect alerts. If the camera is pointed toward a high-traffic area, you won't have to fret about it taping or sending out an alert each time the pet walks by. (We think this is a better function if you're putting the Circle 2 outside, where vehicles frequently pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's terrific that it's not needed, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Webcam.</p>
<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
