We advise cellular systems because they're a lot more secure than landline systems, however there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't readily available. If you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still far better than no security at all.</p>

The average length of a home security contract is 36 months or 3 years. On the greater end, some agreements might span approximately 60 months or 5 years. We would advise considering a DIY home security system rather if you want to prevent having to sign an agreement.</p>
