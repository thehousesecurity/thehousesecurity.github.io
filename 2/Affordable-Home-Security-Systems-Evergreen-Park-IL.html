<p>While every house owner frets about break-ins, skepticism has actually surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high expenses, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in incorrect alarms. Do alarm systems represent theft declines in the United States?

<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
