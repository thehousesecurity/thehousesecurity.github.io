<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, however not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually through 110VAC power.</p>
<p>Recording the video from your security cameras requires hard drives or cloud based storage. The digital video recorder (DVR) that the security cameras are linked to has a difficult drive inside of it if you have an analog security camera system. If your handling recorded video storage on an IP camera system, then your network video recorder (NVR) can utilize hard drives for on-site recording and cloud-based recording in the event of hard disk drive breakdown.</p>
