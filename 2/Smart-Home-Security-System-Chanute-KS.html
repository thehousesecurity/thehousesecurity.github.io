It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and basic motion.
