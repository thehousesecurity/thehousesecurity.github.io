<p>During the night, though it does not have the complete IR LED array of some rivals, the Arlo captures enough light to see a good distance, and there's an adjustable spotlight readily available if you're positioning it outdoors - which nicely brings us to the wonderful motion detection. Not only is the Arlo quick to pick out moving items, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out precisely what it's taking a look at. Simply a couple years ago, the home security industry was dominated by a few huge names offering expensive, rigid plans with little flexibility and hostile, long-lasting agreements. Systems were limited to a couple wired motion sensing units linked to a keypad control board and run through a landline. Nowadays, this has actually all altered.</p>
<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a pleasure to use as well (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you wish to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a learning curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's terrific, though. If you don't currently have an Arlo camera or two in place, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can suggest there are range problems.</p>
