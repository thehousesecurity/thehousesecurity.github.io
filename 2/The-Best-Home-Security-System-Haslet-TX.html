<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video in the dark is a concern.</p>

Basically, security doorbells are just small security cameras - wired or wireless - that include a door buzzer and a 2-way intercom in the frame. Integrating the benefits of a security camera and an intercom gives you a large range of powerful functions to secure your home or business.</p>
