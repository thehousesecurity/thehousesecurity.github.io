<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a destructive enemy, since the disturbance of the network prevents the flow of information and actually indirectly protects information by preventing it from being transferred. The usual reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, offering a chance for the destructive assaulter to tape these codes and utilize different cracking tools to examine security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system.
