<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.

After a while, the camera will discover to determine those people and will send smart device notifies with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
