<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
