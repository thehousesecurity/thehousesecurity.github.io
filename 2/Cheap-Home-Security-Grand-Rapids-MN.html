<p>Relying on the zone activated, number and sequence of zones, time of day, and other aspects, the alarm monitoring center might instantly initiate various actions. Central station operators might be advised to call emergency situation services immediately, or to initially call the safeguarded premises or property supervisor to try to figure out if the alarm is real. Operators could also begin calling a list of phone numbers provided by the client to get in touch with somebody to go check on the protected premises. Some zones may set off a call to the local heating oil company to go look at the system, or a call to the owner with details of which space might be getting flooded.
