Numerous insurer offer discounts on insurance premiums to clients with operable alarm. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous authorities departments use several "complimentary" incorrect alarms prior to enforcing any fine, although the cost to respond is considerable right from the start.
