<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based on our screening, should provide at least a number of months of operation on a charge (depending upon usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of complimentary cloud storage (with more offered for a month-to-month cost ).
