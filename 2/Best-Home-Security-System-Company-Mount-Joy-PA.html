<p>Arlo declares that you need to have the ability to get 4 to 6 months out of a totally charged battery, depending on settings, usage, and surrounding temperature. In long-lasting screening of the camera, we generally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic location. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that varied between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent.
