<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much wider area and therefore provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
