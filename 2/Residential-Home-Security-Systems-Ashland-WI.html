<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we tested, and it provides two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our screening. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces.
