After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term screening, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it needed a complete charge once a month.</p>

When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
