<p>GO2 offers full-service Video Surveillance Installation of high definition (HD), IP, digital, outdoor, and wireless Security Camera Systems. Buying burglar security systems and devices from eBay truly makes alarm companies run away from a sale. A lot of alarm companies would rather provide and install their own equipment rather than go through this hassle. For the most thorough coverage of your home, you want something that includes night vision and can tape-record at a good quality - and almost all cameras now feature a minimum of HD (1080p) resolution.

<p>With an expertly monitored system, when a smoke or intrusion alarm is triggered, an agent will first attempt to reach you by means of the two-way control board before calling your noted telephone number. If you fail to react, the representative will call 911 to dispatch an emergency responder to your home. The great thing about professionally installed systems is you don't need to lift a finger; after you've placed your order a specialist will pertain to your home, set whatever up for you, and show you how the system works.

No duress option: A professionally monitored system often comes with a pressure PIN. The property owner can turn off the alarm using the pressure PIN if an intruder forces a homeowner to disarm the system.

Authorization may be indicated in any number of ways, frequently with codes or keys utilized at the control board or a remote panel near an entry.

<p>If I liked the look of the Nest, then I enjoy the Hive View's design - surely the most visually pleasing camera on this list. The good-looking shiny black cube, magnetically affixed to a brushed metal stand (mine came in a lovely rose-gold but you can also get it in silver) strikes the ideal balance in between attractive and subtle enough to not draw attention to itself. Night Vision is also good. When everyone sit under the patio area, the camera can catch all those faces.</p>
