<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I was in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Really irritating. Once again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not mention the 3 year commitment.

This suggests they normally over-expose what is nearby in a scene, triggering individuals and things to appear burnt out" and without any detail. So much for attempting to identify the bad men. Commercial cameras, however, often are equipped with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can adjust their brightness instantly to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the subjects appear properly exposed and in full detail.
