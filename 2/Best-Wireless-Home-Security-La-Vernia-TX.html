<p>Frontpoint uses 5 packages and two monitoring plans: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester went with the Interactive plan but ended up disappointed with its lack of live video surveillance.

It turned out to be a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>

<p>All of the self-installed systems I evaluated can function without a monitoring strategy, however then they are restricted to simply sounding an alarm inside your home and in many cases, pushing a notice to your phone and do not have the ability to immediately dispatch authorities or emergency personnel.

<p>Ring has an extremely inexpensive professional monitoring plan if you desire to take a break from self-monitoring. For simply $10 per month, you can add cellular monitoring, expert monitoring, in addition to 60 days of cloud storage for all of your Ring cameras, which is a great deal.
