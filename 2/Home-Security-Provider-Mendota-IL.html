The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers 7 days of free cloud storage (with more readily available for a regular monthly fee ).

If home security is your primary concern, we 'd recommend one of our top choices, but the Arlo is great for signing in on family and pets-- or stray felines slinking around your backyard.</p>
