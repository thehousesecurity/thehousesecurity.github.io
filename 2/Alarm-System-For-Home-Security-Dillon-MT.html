<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we checked, and it offers two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership.

The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces.

Recordings are simple to discover under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, however we don't suggest that for home security due to the fact that if it's stolen, you don't have a backup.</p>
