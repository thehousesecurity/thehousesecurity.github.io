<p>Bullet cameras are among the two most common CCTV camera types. They have a long cylindrical shape, providing their name and an unique appearance. This look is identifiable to nearly everybody and therefore serves as a deterrent to undesirable individuals. The hope is trespassers and lawbreakers go in other places rather if security cameras are visible. That being stated, bullet cameras are more prone to vandalism because of their obvious appearance.
