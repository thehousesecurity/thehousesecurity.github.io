This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for further wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR.
