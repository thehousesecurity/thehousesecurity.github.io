Amongst IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send out information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and permits that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A typical misunderstanding is that wireless means the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still need a power cord. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then links to a router and the internet.
