<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, due to the fact that it is instead connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll require to know whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder before buying.</p>
