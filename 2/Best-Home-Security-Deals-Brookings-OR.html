<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
