<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. When it spotted any type of interference, SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration saying the system would notify users. The company likewise questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be an ideal storm of scenarios for someone to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to replicate the problem. Although our screening shouldn't be taken as definitive, we believe this problem is not likely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe clients who own the current system.</p>
<p>Nurse calling systems generally include emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's washroom. He can press the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station if a client is having trouble. This is a simple switch that is normally open or generally closed. The majority of your commercial security cameras include dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and notifies, sensing units, access control, and so on. My mind conceived an approach of not only offering the client with the patient-monitoring system however integrating it into their old nurse call station system.</p>
