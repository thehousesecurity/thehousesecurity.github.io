As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
