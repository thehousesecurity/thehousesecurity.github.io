<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical since the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
