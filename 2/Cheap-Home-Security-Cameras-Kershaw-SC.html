<p>We provide value-added security and surveillance systems and services providing benefit, comfort and satisfaction to every consumer and are committed to satisfying our consumer's requirements with integrity, honesty, enthusiasm and exceptional service. Among IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send out information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and permits that user to see the video from anywhere. A common misunderstanding is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still need a power cable. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder straight which then links to a router and the internet. Lastly, wire-free cameras are completely cable television free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the simplest option to install and all of the tape-recorded video is kept in the cloud.</p>
