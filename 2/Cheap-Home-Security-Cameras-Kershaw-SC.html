Among IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send out information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and permits that user to see the video from anywhere. A common misunderstanding is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still need a power cable. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder straight which then links to a router and the internet. Lastly, wire-free cameras are completely cable television free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the simplest option to install and all of the tape-recorded video is kept in the cloud.</p>
