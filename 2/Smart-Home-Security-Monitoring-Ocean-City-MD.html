<p>Dependability is a highly subjective when it comes to technology matter, depending on which features and benefits a specific favors. Wireless security systems are more agile and integratable, but low signal strength and bad connection are still common problems.

<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive aggressor, given that the interruption of the network prevents the circulation of information and actually indirectly protects data by preventing it from being transmitted. The usual factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, offering an opportunity for the harmful aggressor to record these codes and utilize different breaking tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can launch a dictionary design attack of "potentially accepted" security secrets based upon the "design" security crucial caught throughout the network recovery.</p>
