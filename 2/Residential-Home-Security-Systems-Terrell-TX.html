<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>

This implies that the transgressor should be aware of the included surveillance for it to accomplish its wanted result.</p>
