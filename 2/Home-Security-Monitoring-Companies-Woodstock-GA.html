If you're stressed over charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have actually not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that fluctuated between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-term screening, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>
