The cameras will be monitored by the Jefferson County City Location Crime Center The license plate recognition camera information will be submitted to the FBI's Criminal Justice Info Services, and the city will get the content from the FBI's website.

Whereas dome cameras are smaller and more discreet. These compact cameras are ideal for monitoring a larger location such as your front or back garden and can follow movement with ease.</p>
