<p>6 basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Put simply, wireless security systems rely on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work utilizing radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensing units, lights and other security equipment are all connected to one base station or panel to receive sensors needed to manage your equipment consisting of enabling, disabling and sending you instantaneous alerts. As soon as a signal is received, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, text, web, or e-mail website. They'll also get an alert to immediately help you with emergency responders as needed if your wireless home security system is professionally monitored.</p>

A system of door controls, supplemented by video surveillance cameras geared up with an audio and remote release capability might be utilized, that permits the security officer, who may be physically positioned far from the entryway, to authorize and give access as needed. Authorized personnel can bypass the requirement to request a release of the lock by utilize of a key electronic push-button, card access gadget, or biometric technology.</p>

Disaster protection - you can link a z-wave smoke and carbon monoxide alarm to the app. Disadvantage: some systems have a high rate of incorrect alarms since some of these sensing units may be too sensitive. Although systems utilizing DSP (digital signal processing) will largely eliminate incorrect alarms on some cases.</p>
