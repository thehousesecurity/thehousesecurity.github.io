<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are 3 times more likely to be robbed. On July 1, 2019, Monitronics International - the company that offers sponsorship for Brinks Home Security - filed for voluntary insolvency Under the terms of the new plan, Brinks expects to continue to run normally, supplying first-class security services with no disruption to their workers, clients, and partners. As to how water resistant it is, time will tell. I hedged my bets and siliconed the body joint and where the wire goes into the back of the camera. I have this mounted on the side of my rv, so it'll be evaluated.</p>

Whereas dome cameras are smaller and more discreet. These compact cameras are perfect for monitoring a bigger location such as your front or back garden and can follow motion with ease.</p>

Just as with the redesigned equipment, this home automation update puts it in league with competitors-- especially those with Do It Yourself installation.</p>

Anran HD 8CH Wireless Security System features four HD cameras with advanced night vision capabilities, a built-in hard drive, and an integrated wireless router to supply continuously surveillance all the time.</p>
