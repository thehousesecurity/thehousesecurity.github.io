<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
<p>A more cost effective option to monitored systems, unmonitored systems may include a lot of the same features as their monitored equivalent, consisting of cameras, alarms, and sensors, but they are not observed by a security service, meaning homeowners will not be paying the expensive regular monthly expenses connected with monitored security systems.
