<p>Indoor cameras are fantastic for keeping an eye on your animals and kids, however if you're concerned about security, you do not wish to risk missing out on a second of the action. That's why we recommend the corded version of the Logitech Circle 2, which supplies constant recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage free of charge, with choices for more via membership. Although it does not have the widest operating temperature level variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the couple of cameras on our list that come with a truly weatherproof cord and plug.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
