<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
