Amongst IP security choices, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the footage from anywhere. A common mistaken belief is that wireless means the camera is wire-free.

Lastly, wire-free cameras are completely cable television free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are necessary, these are the simplest alternative to install and all of the tape-recorded footage is saved in the cloud.</p>
