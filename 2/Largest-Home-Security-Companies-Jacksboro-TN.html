<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services offering benefit, assurance and satisfaction to every client and are devoted to fulfilling our customer's requirements with stability, sincerity, enthusiasm and excellent service. Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, spanning several years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually developed into the extremely advanced yet budget-friendly systems available today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to record video and view it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
<p>If you hold down the panic or smoke alarm buttons on the alarm system touchpad for 1 to 3 seconds, an alarm is sent to the ADT monitoring center, and emergency services are dispatched immediately. An alarm received in this way can not be canceled. A few years earlier, there were only a handful of security companies in the video game. Now, there are lots. House owners selecting a system needs to look for a reputable, reliable company. A number of the very best security companies have actually been in the home security business for years, long before the idea of self-monitored systems even existed.
