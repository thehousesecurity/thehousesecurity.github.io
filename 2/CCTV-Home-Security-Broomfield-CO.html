These systems sometimes cost more in advance for the hardware than pro systems that offer a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service contract.

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest).
