<p>The Wyze Camera v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security alternative (although we enjoyed it as a family pet camera ). It has given that been enhanced and now rivals our top choices due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and a number of smart-home integration choices. We value that the company continues to repeat and improve an item that costs about as much as a pizza.

The answer depends upon a number of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you intend to keep and how long you prepare to keep recorded video footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest footage once you reach the system's capability, however if you're not cautious, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>

The majority of your commercial security cameras include dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and alerts, sensing units, gain access to control, and so on.
