That's a high cost for home automation when compared to competitors like Vivint, which lets you add those functions at every tier (beginning at $40 each month).

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest).

We believe that's expensive.</p>
