<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
