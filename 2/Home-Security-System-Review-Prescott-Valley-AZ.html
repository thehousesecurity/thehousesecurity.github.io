Bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor choices because their style enables minimum glare.

However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
