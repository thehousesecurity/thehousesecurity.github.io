<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, because it is instead connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
