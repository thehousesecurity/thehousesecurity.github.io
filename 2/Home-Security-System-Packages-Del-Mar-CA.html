When it found any type of interference, SimpliSafe responded with a declaration stating the system would alert users. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a best storm of situations for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to reproduce the concern.
