Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
