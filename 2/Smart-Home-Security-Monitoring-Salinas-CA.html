Simply relocated to Los Angeles and I think I'm going to buy a home security system for the very first time. I like the mobility and low cost of Ring and SimpliSafe, but seems like ADT is still the best choice in spite of the higher cost. I think when compared to the cost of my house, it's a pretty cheap price to pay to keep it protected and safe.</p>
