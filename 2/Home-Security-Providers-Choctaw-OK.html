<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can protect that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension set, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This implies the Circle 2 ends up being more expensive general per system than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof option.
