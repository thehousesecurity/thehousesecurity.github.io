"As soon as the criminal offense and offense figures were gotten used to take account of the basic down pattern in criminal activities and offenses," criminologists discovered in one research study, "reductions were noted in particular classifications but there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had minimized criminal activity in general in the city centre."
