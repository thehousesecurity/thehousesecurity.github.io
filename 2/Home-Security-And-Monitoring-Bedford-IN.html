You don't wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "individuals may find out to be careful about the books and periodicals they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm hidden observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, hookers or drug addicts." Certainly, the research studies of cameras in Britain discovered that people considered to be "out of time and location" with the environments underwent prolonged surveillance.</p>

<p>The wireless network seeks all restricted to a small geographical location. A computer connected to the Web and having inappropriate setups or other security issues can be exploited by anybody from anywhere in the world, while only clients in a small geographical range can exploit an open wireless access point. Therefore the direct exposure is low with an open wireless gain access to point, and the risks with having an open wireless network are small.
