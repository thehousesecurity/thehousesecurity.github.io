<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition.

The gadget gathers the infrared radiation from things in the scene and develops an electronic image based upon details about the temperature differences. Because objects are hardly ever exactly the same temperature as other things around them, a thermal camera can detect them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>
