<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
