<p>Despite having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug.

Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not suggest it given that its battery-saving routines can interrupt efficiency.</p>
