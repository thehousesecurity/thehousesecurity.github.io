Thankfully, their systems are DIY; we had our cameras and sensors set up in about 25 minutes (not excellent, however not dreadful). The home intrusion features were on-point, but we want to see more smart-home choices available out-of-the-box. Note that Frontpoint systems are Z-Wave suitable, so we had the ability to link third-party gadgets for some nifty home. automation functions.</p>
