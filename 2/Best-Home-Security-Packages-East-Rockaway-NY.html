<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and again in consumer reviews, and it provides a crisp image up to 32 feet. And although the app and software application are simple to work with, it's a little a disappointment that you can't integrate this camera with any smart home hubs or gizmos.

Tech is supposed to make our lives much easier and Hive's environment lives up to that. It's all the function without any frustration.</p>
