Aspects we thought about consisted of the quality of the security cameras (do they have motion detection and night vision?), exists a monitoring plan, can window sensing units and door sensing units be integrated, whether the system had a mobile app, can it work with your door locks and can it be incorporated into an existing clever home setup, including with voice commands through Amazon Alexa.</p>

Likewise, if the camera is in the middle of recording, don't anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
