<p>Everybody we dealt with at NSS were very valuable and accommodating. The services they supplied were precisely what we wanted, and they performed with professionalism and skills. I'm not exactly sure if any consumer-grade outdoor camera performs all that well when it's foggy or raining, specifically at night when weather conditions really tinker the night vision.

It can also inform you to something taking place out of the camera's field of vision.
