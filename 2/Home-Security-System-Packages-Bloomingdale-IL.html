<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our screening-- during the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the photo quality based on offered bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
