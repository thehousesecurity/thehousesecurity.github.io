<p>Wireless security cameras being evaluated in a Customer Reports laboratory. If you do experience a home intrusion emergency situation, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am somewhat disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas lots of other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. Despite that, the alarm ought to suffice to frighten intruders for the most part. Security cameras are a terrific start to securing your home.
