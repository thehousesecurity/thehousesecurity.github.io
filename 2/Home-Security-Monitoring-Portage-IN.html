When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those people and will send mobile phone notifies with that info when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
<p>Capable of operating in both regular and badly lit environments, these cameras benefit from not needing inbuilt infrared illuminators as they can catch clear video images in the dark thanks to their extra delicate imaging chips. For this reason, these cameras are ideal for outdoor surveillance applications in which IR cameras are unable to work optimally.
