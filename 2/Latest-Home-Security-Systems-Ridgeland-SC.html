In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.

<h3>Apartment Security System Ridgeland SC 29936</h3>
