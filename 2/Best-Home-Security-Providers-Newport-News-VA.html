<p>The Hive View delivers terrific 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation activated too easily, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Considering that this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to manually stop alerts (and recording, considering that it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity problems, with 2 Hive test units detaching 8 times over 2 months. Scout is very simple to utilize, specifically if you're a fan of mobile phones.

It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
