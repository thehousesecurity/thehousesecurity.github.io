<p>Good photo and I like that the cameras are white, they do not stick out too much. Pretty simple to install. I also like that I can download the app in my android phone and see my cameras from far from the house. The second essential thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably ear-piercing inbuilt alarm, so it operates as a home alarm along with a security camera. That distinguishes it from the items I've already composed, and assists in part to discuss its rate.</p>

<p>As for how to use one, they work the same as the majority of other security cameras and hook into your existing doorbell setup. Often you don't even need to hardwire them, depending upon which model you select. Just like any security system, the more equipment you add, the costlier it gets.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
