(Ord. 2002-28 § 1, 2002). The downside to monitored systems is the cost.

IP cameras that are linked to the same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
