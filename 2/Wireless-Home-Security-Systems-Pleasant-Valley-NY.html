<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
