<p>I" m not pleased with this item. It requires an addition disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is decent. The motion sensing units work well.

Many users are not very pleased with the way dispatch calls from the monitoring system function for false alarms since they can often lead to added fees. Additionally, the total opinion is that the company's customer support is not extremely valuable when it comes to recurring and fixing problems use problems. Establishing the Arlo Pro 2 is a faff, including a white box that links to your router through an ethernet cable.
