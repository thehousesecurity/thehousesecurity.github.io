<p>For these different systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single interface, a comprehensive knowledge of all the required systems is required. There are only two alternatives if there are no as-built files providing performance and setup information to make this integration work. The very first choice, which may be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial service provider is unwilling or unavailable to offer those details) and record the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other approach is to change and rip, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to converge them all.</p>
