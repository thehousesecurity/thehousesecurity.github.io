<p>First and foremost, it's hard to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, however it's much better than a lot of cameras that are four times the rate. The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after practically 2 years of usage, night and day images have actually always been clear, and we never ever had problems with the camera missing motion, an issue we encountered when checking the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a creative function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion discovered. We've seen it highlight mice, vehicles, and moths.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
