<h3>Best Security Camera System in Lakeville MN</h3>

<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
