<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
