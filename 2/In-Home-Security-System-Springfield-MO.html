<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
