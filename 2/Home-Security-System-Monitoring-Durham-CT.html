A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that is capable of detecting small distinctions in temperature. The device collects the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and produces an electronic image based upon details about the temperature level differences. Since objects are seldom exactly the same temperature as other items around them, a thermal camera can identify them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>
