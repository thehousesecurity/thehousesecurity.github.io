<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
