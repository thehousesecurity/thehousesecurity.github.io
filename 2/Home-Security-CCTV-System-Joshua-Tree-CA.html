<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
