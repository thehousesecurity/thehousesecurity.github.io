<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
