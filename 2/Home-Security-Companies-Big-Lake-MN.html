That stated, we have definitely no other qualms about the Swann's motion detection credentials - it's satisfies in terms of level of sensitivity, avoiding incorrect positives in our tests and throwing in heat detection as an added benefit. It fasts to send out an alert and convenient  in terms of storage given that it supports both cloud uploading and an on-board microSD card for each camera.</p>
<p>There's no dedicated hub involved here - each camera links directly to your router via Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there.
