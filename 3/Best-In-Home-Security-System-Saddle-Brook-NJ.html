<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Sound for a well-priced DIY system that you can self-monitor or get expertly monitored for a small cost. We suggest the eight-piece package because it includes numerous windows and door sensing units for complete protection. We likewise recommend including a doorbell camera eventually.
