<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, must provide at least a number of months of operation on a charge (depending on usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that provides 7 days of totally free cloud storage (with more offered for a monthly cost ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo states will allow the camera to appropriately identify motion and not get stuck taping on a loop. That likewise conserves battery life, but it might leave you with recording spaces throughout essential security events. If home security is your primary concern, we 'd suggest among our top picks, however the Arlo is terrific for checking in on family and family pets-- or stray cats slinking around your lawn.</p>
