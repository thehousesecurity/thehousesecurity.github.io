In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with an offered video recorder before buying.</p>
