<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and basic motion.
