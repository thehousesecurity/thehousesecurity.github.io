<p>While every house owner stresses over break-ins, hesitation has surrounded home security systems due to their typically high costs, complex contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces frequently leading to false alarms. Nearly all wireless home security systems utilize a cellular connection; for that reason, if your internet decreases or your power goes out, your security system will still work. However, there are still some wireless home security systems that utilize an internet connection as their primary interaction source. Most internet connected security systems feature a battery backup, which indicates if the power heads out your alarm will still work for a minimal amount of time.

If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide.
