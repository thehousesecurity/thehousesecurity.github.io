SimpliSafe responded with a statement saying the system would signal users when it spotted any kind of disturbance. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would require to be a perfect storm of situations for someone to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to reproduce the issue.

<p>It is difficult to deny the huge advantage consumers gain by connecting their security cameras to the Internet, though as is frequently mentioned by the media, there are hackers hiding everywhere. It has actually become a fact of Internet life that no computer system is 100% safe, and sadly, security camera systems are at risk also.
