This suggests they normally over-expose what neighbors in a scene, causing people and objects to appear burnt out" and with no information. So much for attempting to identify the bad men. Commercial cameras, nevertheless, frequently are equipped with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can adjust their brightness immediately to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the subjects appear appropriately exposed and in full detail.
