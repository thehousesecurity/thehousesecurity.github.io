We value that the company continues to iterate and improve an item that costs about as much as a pizza.

<p>The Ring Stick Up Webcam can be found in wired and battery variations, which can be utilized inside and outdoors. However neither can record continuously, and they both need the Ring Protect strategy to catch recordings.

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
