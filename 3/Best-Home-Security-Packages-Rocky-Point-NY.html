Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to disregard things that exert percentages of pressure on the wires.
