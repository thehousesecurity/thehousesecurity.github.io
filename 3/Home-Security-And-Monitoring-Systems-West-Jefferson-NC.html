<p>A wired security system was the very first type of security system that was created for house owners. It must be set up by an expert alarm installation team and, when set up, is difficult to move from one location to another. Wired systems are more common for large properties and are often more costly than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera just like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the group will need to rework the existing wires in your home. The group will be able to recycle the existing electrical wiring if you have actually currently set up a wired system in the past and you are upgrading to a new system. Nevertheless, if this is your first system, the alarm installation process can take upwards of 3 hours.</p>
