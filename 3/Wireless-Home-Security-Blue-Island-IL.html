<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, ought to offer at least a number of months of operation on a charge (depending upon usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of complimentary cloud storage (with more offered for a monthly charge ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo states will permit the camera to correctly spot motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop.
