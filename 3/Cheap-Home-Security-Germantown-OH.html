As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
