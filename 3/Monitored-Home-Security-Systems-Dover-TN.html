<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a house owner forgets their keys and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is activated by a community cat, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly.
