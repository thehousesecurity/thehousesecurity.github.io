<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids consulting with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly common. If a house owner forgets their secrets and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is activated by a community feline, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a property owner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the essential action.</p>
