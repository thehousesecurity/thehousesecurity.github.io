<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
