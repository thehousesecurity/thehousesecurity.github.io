<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching.

Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer.
