They do the job, however they will not win any awards for their eye candy.

<p>For the a lot of part, I believe that Philips Shade's outdoor lights are overpriced and actually just worth it if you want to spend lavishly That said, I actually liked the Philips Hue Outdoor Sensor, which you can get for less than $50. Stick it up anywhere you like outside, and it'll track motion, temperature and ambient light conditions.

We suggest cellular systems due to the fact that they're much more secure than landline systems, however there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't readily available. If you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still much better than no security at all.</p>
