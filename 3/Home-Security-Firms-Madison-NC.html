To get the best and brightest night view, think about a camera with infrared (IR) technology to sending brilliant light through wavelengths. The number of infrared LEDs utilized in a camera figures out how far your outdoor security camera will be able to clearly reveal what's outside your home. Try to find surveillance cameras that have at least 100 feet or much better of night vision. Lots of designs also have an integrated IR cut-switch that automatically enables and disables the infrared technology depending on the lighting conditions.</p>

<p>Just bought a bullet ip system and absolutely enjoy it. Excellent clearness. I wanted to establish viewing on my cellular phone but had a couple questions that the tech addressed with ease. I Would certainly purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly advise this company.
