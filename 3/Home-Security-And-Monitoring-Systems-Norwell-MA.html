The Fortress Security Shop Home Security System features a built-in and a remote wireless siren with adjustable volume.

I am a little disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas numerous other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm should be enough to scare away intruders for the most part. Security cameras are a fantastic start to protecting your home.
