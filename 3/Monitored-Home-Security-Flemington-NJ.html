<h2>Small Business Security Systems Flemington</h2>
<p>We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for one of our top areas. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape-record as much as 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were frequently missing, regardless of showing up in the app's activity timeline.

But neither can tape-record constantly, and they both need the Ring Secure plan to catch recordings. Also, the wired variation usually left gaps of up to 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery version left about a minute in between 30-second clips. Both also lack person detection and geofencing, which other cameras utilize to cut down on incorrect alerts.</p>
