Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I checked, consisting of smart things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit.

<p>For those who are still fretted about their security system being hacked into, there are actions that can be required to decrease the risk. The first of them is to secure the system. Set up firewall programs, look for firmware updates, utilize a strong password, frequently alter old passwords, and get gadgets that support two-factor authentication.
