<p>I" m not pleased with this product. It needs an addition disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The picture quality is decent. The motion sensors work well.

Calling in a service technician costs more, however for those who prefer to let a professional deal with the job and do not mind spending the money, professional installation is the way to go.</p>
