<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
<h3>Security System Alarm in York ME</h3>

Night Vision is likewise good. The camera can capture all those faces when everybody sit under the outdoor patio.</p>

Because whatever is just stuck onto the wall and not hardwired, eliminating cameras, detectors, and other elements of a wireless security system and putting them up in a new place takes minutes, not days.

A wireless system can be relocated to a new home quickly, an advantage for those who lease or who move frequently.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
