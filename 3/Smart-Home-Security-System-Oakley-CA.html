<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we checked, and it offers two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our screening. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And in spite of having an attractive rate and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 each year to the cost of an otherwise spending plan camera.</p>
