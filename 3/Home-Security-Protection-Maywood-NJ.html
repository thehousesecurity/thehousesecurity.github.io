<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is an excellent security camera and an incredible value. It gets an Exceptional score for video quality and is simpler to use than the other cameras on this list. It likewise does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid subscription plans for additional cloud storage.

Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>

It's important to keep in mind that in some areas you might need to file for a license to have a security system installed in your home.</p>

Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I evaluated, consisting of clever things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit.
