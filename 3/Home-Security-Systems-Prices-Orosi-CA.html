A 2005 study for the British Home Office likewise found that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the fear of criminal offense (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British federal government).</p>

That individual at Deep Sentinel's facility can alert a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local authorities dispatcher if they refuse to engage or leave in a criminal act.
