<p>Arlo declares that you must be able to get 4 to 6 months out of a completely charged battery, depending upon settings, use, and surrounding temperature.

After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent.
