Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I tested, including clever things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. However the Secure is costly, extra sensors are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which does not include emergency alarm or camera backups-- is also costly if you don't dedicate to a three-year contract.</p>
