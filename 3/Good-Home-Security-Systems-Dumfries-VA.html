This is also referred to as the rational option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime prevention strategy, which argues that chances to anger can be lowered by modifying a variety of systems such as increasing the danger of a transgressor being captured, increasing the effort to commit the criminal offense, reducing benefits from crime commission, and reducing provocations that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).
