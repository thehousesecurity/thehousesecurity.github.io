When a camera attempts to see in the dark, it needs a source of light to illuminate the area listed below it.

This means they normally over-expose what is nearby in a scene, causing objects and individuals to appear blown out" and with no information. A lot for trying to determine the bad guys. Commercial cameras, nevertheless, often are geared up with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can adjust their brightness immediately to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear effectively exposed and in full information.
