Rules are needed to establish a clear public understanding of such problems as whether video signals are taped, under what conditions, and the length of time are they maintained; what the criteria are for access to archived video by other government firms, or by the public; how the guidelines would be confirmed and imposed; and what punishments would use to violators.</p>
