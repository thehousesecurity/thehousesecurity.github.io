We appreciate that the company continues to iterate and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other choices, it has a restricted field of view, and Wyze says it prepares to do away with individual detection, at least momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
