Arlo states that the system uses 3 layers of encryption, with limited Web gain access to on the Base Station and no local gain access to on the camera or the Base Station.

Alarms activated by legal but unintentional entry to the residential or commercial property, i.e. kids returning home, visitors, neighbors looking after the home while you are on getaway and delivery men do not fulfill the requirement for waiver.</p>
