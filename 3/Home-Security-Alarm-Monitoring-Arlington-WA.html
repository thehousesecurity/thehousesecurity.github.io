<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>

<h3>Basic Home Security in Washington</h3>
<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, removing the need for further circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera independently, typically via 110VAC power.</p>
<p>It worked well when we checked the Ring alarm equipment. The door sensing units are a bit big, which can be bothersome for doors with small or molded frames. (To combat this issue, Ring's released a slim magnet, which can be bought individually.) And the $199 five-piece set doesn't have sufficient equipment to guard most homes totally.
