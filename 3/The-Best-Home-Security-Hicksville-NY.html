When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send out smart device alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
