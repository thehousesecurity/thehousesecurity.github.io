<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send out mobile phone signals with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers.
