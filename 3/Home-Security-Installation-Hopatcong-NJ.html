<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>

Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it because its battery-saving regimens can interrupt efficiency.</p>
