<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
