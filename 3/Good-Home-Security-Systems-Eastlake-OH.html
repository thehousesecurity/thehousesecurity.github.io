<p>The Wyze Webcam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security alternative (although we liked it as a family pet webcam ). It has actually since been enhanced and now matches our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and numerous smart-home combination options. We value that the company continues to iterate and improve an item that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other choices, it has a limited field of view, and Wyze states it plans to do away with individual detection, a minimum of momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>

The Ooma Butterfleye has no night vision and has bad daytime video; the Reolink C1 Pro often displayed green and pink lines across the screen; the Yi Dome Camera continuously flickered at night; and the Samsung SmartCam had bad audio and a confusing app.</p>

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>

For example, we like the Abode Iota, which integrates your alarm system's hub with a night vision indoor security camera. However as far as clever home things goes, House is a choose your own experience video game.</p>
