The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after nearly 2 years of night, day and use images have actually constantly been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing out on motion, a problem we encountered when testing the Wyze Web cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted. We have actually seen it highlight cars, mice, and moths.</p>
