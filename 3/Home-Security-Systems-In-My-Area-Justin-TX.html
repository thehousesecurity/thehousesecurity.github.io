<p>ALARM USER. Any person, firm, association or corporation of any kind in control of any building, structure or center where an alarm is set up, operated and kept. When it comes to an occupancy, the tenant will be considered the sole alarm user at the alarm website. The other significant choice when picking a home security camera is whether you require an outdoor or indoor camera.
