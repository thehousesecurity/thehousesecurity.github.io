In each of the reviews that follow this buyers' guide, we'll discuss how each camera delivers on these features.</p>
<p>The Wyze Camera v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security option (although we enjoyed it as a pet webcam ).

We value that the company continues to repeat and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other picks, it has a limited field of view, and Wyze says it prepares to do away with person detection, a minimum of momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
