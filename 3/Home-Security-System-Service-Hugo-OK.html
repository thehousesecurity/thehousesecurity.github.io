<p>One category where SimpliSafe has actually gotten rather dissatisfying reviews is customer support. A lot of users are not very happy with the way dispatch calls from the monitoring system function for false alarms due to the fact that they can regularly result in added fees. Furthermore, the general viewpoint is that the company's customer care is not really useful when it concerns recurring and repairing problems use problems.
