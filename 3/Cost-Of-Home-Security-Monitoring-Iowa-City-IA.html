A few of these might look like dome cameras, but there's a basic technique to differentiate them - if the lens and the IR LEDs are in front of the glass on the housing instead of consisted of behind it, you have actually got a turret camera rather of a dome.</p>

A membership also guarantees that you'll be covered if you disappear for a few days.
