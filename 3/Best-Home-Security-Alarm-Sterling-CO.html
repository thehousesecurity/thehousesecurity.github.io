<p>Lots of full-time" residents with alarm systems inform us that they are home all the time" and question why they would require monitoring. However, people need to take into account the frequency and duration of their lacks from home or business - rather than just their occupancy. Who is home, when they are not? Who will hear and react to the alarm? And so on. Less than half the protection the client expects is being supplied if that system is not monitored.</p>

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare people and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
