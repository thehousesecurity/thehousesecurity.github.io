<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise nice metal construction.
