<p>I have this camera hooked up to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without trouble. The IR lights in the evening are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the cost and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>I" m not pleased with this item. It requires an addition hard disk for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The picture quality is good. The motion sensors work well.
