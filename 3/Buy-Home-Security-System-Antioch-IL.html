Burglar alarms are meant to prevent break-in and to help authorities nab burglars, which, if done reliably and efficiently, benefits the public at big.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal because the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when clients understand that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
