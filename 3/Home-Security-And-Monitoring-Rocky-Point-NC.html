<h3>Residential Security Systems in Rocky Point NC</h3>

When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends dual signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the risk and, if required, might just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
