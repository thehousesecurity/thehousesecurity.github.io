<p>The security systems above are our favorites, but we found three more companies you might be interested in if you have some specialized needs. No duress option: An expertly monitored system often includes a duress PIN. If an intruder forces a property owner to disarm the system, the homeowner can switch off the alarm using the pressure PIN. While the alarm is off, the duress code works as a secret signal to the monitoring company to send help right away. Self-monitoring systems don't have this alternative.</p>
<p>If your home is not pre-wired for a wired security system, the best alternative may be to go wireless. Wireless security systems are a network of sensing units, motion detectors and surveillance cameras that can be installed without expert assistance and are totally mobile.

When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send out smartphone signals with that details when they appear at your home.
