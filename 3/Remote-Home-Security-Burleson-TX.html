As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
