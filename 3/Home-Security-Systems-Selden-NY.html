<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm, a variety of companies provide "free monitoring services" for the very first couple of months. Many insurer use discount rates on insurance coverage premiums to customers with operable alarm systems. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of police departments offer a number of "complimentary" incorrect alarms before enforcing any fine, although the cost to respond is considerable right from the start. The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance companies bring into question the appropriateness of the existing trend in U.S. policing of enabling three or four complimentary false alarms per calendar year, because they provide no up-front rewards to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
