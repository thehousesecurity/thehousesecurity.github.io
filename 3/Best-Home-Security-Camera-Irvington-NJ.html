If you're worried about charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that fluctuated in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic.
