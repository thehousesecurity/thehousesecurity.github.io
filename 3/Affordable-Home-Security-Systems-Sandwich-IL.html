<h2>How To Position Home Security Cameras Sandwich</h2>

<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
