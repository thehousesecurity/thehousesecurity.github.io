<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.

Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
