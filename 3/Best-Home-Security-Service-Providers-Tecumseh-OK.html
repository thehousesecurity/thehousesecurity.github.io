<p>Not all security cameras operate in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light abilities have a shutter that permits more light to get in the camera's sensor. The more light that is enabled to get in the camera the brighter the image will be. Nevertheless, even these low light capable cameras have digital noise that make the dark image appearance fuzzy.
