<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
