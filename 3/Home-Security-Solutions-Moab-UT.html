Pro-installed systems normally cost more, use equipment similar to that of DIY systems, included normally difficult and long agreements, and typically count on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they offer little advantage.

<p>Despite the fact that they tend to be more costly than unmonitored systems, they do give you assurance. That's because when your system is tripped, a signal will be sent out to the company via your phone line, notifying them that there's an intruder in your house. Within around 10 seconds you'll get a telephone call from the security company (by means of the intercom system or your telephone), where you'll be asked to verify who you are by utilizing a permission code.

<p>There need to be a clear line of vision between wireless transceivers, so that each camera can see" the home structure to transmit video.
