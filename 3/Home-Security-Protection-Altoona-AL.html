<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
