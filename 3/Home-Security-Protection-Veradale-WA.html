Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to discover any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge.
