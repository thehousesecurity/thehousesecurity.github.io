<p>Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you plan to keep and for how long you plan to keep taped video. The footage is going to consume up storage space rapidly if there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution.
