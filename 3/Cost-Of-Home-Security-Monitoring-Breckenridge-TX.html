<p>Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a number of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you mean to keep and how long you prepare to keep documented footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to eat up storage space quickly.
