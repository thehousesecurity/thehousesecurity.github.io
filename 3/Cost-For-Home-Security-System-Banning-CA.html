Figure 1-1 illustrates an example of a CCTV installation that monitors select locations of protection. The first installation was created and established for the different parking facility. This application included a number of fixed position cameras on each floor of the parking lot, stairwells, and exits, all connected directly to a primary control system (PCU) for management of each video stream.

Now, intruders regularly cut the telephone lines to organisations and homes, even whole neighborhoods, prior to breaking in.
