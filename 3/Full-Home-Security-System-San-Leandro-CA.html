<p>The genuine factor cameras are usually deployed is to reduce much pettier criminal offenses. But it has actually not even been demonstrated that they can do that.

A 2005 research study for the British Office also discovered that cameras did not cut criminal offense or the worry of criminal activity (as had a 2002 research study, likewise for the British federal government).</p>
