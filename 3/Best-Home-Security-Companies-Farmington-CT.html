<p>Simply purchased a bullet ip system and definitely like it. Fantastic clarity. I wished to set up viewing on my mobile phone however had a couple questions that the tech answered with ease. I Would definitely purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly advise this company.

<p>The real reason cameras are generally deployed is to reduce much pettier criminal activities. However it has actually not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been thoroughly deployed in public places, sociologists studying the problem have found that they have actually not reduced criminal offense. "Once the criminal activity and offense figures were gotten used to appraise the general downward pattern in crimes and offenses," criminologists found in one research study, "decreases were noted in specific classifications but there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had actually minimized criminal offense overall in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office also found that cameras did not cut crime or the worry of crime (as had a 2002 study, also for the British federal government).</p>
