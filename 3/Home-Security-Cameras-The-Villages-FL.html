<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send out smartphone signals with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
<p>Audio and video verification methods utilize microphones and cameras to record audio frequencies, video signals, or image photos.

<p>I" m not pleased with this product. It requires an addition hard disk for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is good. The motion sensors work well. I would not recommend it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pressed for time might choose to install their own systems to prevent scheduling visits and taking some time off from work. Calling in a professional costs more, however for those who prefer to let an expert deal with the task and do not mind spending the money, expert installation is the way to go.</p>
