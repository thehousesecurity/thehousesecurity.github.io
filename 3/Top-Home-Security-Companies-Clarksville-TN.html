<h3>Home Alarm System Monitoring in Clarksville TN</h3>
<p>I explained that all we would need to do is take advantage of any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends out double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the risk and, if required, could just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>

<p>The cost of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, since it consists of three outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds costly, but it's not a lot when you think about that a live human being is viewing a live feed whenever the cameras find suspicious activity.

<p>Saving uncompressed digital recordings takes up a huge amount of hard disk drive space, and a couple of hours of uncompressed video might quickly fill up a disk drive. Holiday uncompressed recordings might look fine but one might not run uncompressed quality recordings on a continuous basis.
