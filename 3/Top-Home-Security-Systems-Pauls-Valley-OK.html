ADT released a Do It Yourself security system in late January with the Blue Outdoor Camera, the Blue Indoor Camera, and the Blue Doorbell Camera Each item can be used individually or as part of heaven by ADT security system, which is arranged to introduce this summer. It will consist of a standalone hub and keypad, with sensing units and other gadgets to follow. All of the products will be functional with or without the live monitoring service, which costs $20 each month (or $23 with unlimited video storage).</p>

It's the leading company in home automation technology and it designs the majority of its own equipment, including the Vivint video doorbell.
