<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts whenever you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
