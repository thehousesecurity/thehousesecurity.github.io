<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it captures a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notices and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is poor. Also, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, don't anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
