<p>All persons with alarm systems securing a facility in the City of Fredericksburg need to have a legitimate alarm permit. While monitored systems are more detailed and do the majority of the work for you, an unmonitored system depends on someone accountable (we're looking at you) to assist do a few of the work. You can usually install these systems on your own, and they are much, much less expensive. Likewise, there's no fear of getting into an agreement you can't get away when you need to.
