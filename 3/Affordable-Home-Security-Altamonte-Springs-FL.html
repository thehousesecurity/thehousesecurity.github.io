<p>During the night, though it does not have the full IR LED range of some rivals, the Arlo captures enough light to see a good distance, and there's an adjustable spotlight readily available if you're positioning it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the wonderful motion detection. Not just is the Arlo quick to pick out moving products, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out precisely what it's taking a look at. Simply a couple years earlier, the home security market was controlled by a couple of big names using pricey, rigid plans with little flexibility and hostile, long-lasting contracts.
