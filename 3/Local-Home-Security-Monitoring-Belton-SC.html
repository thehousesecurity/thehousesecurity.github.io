<p>Note too that security systems aren't almost criminal activity prevention: Most have add-on sensing units that can secure your home from fire, flood, and even temperature changes (to prevent pipelines from bursting, for one thing). Likewise, many of these systems can integrate with other smart-home gadgets, such as thermostats, locks, and light bulbs.

<p>CCTV cameras are much better at catching criminals after they have actually committed a criminal activity, instead of being able to stop a criminal activity in development.

Having a large number of visible CCTV cameras in public locations might serve as some level of deterrent, understanding you are being filmed, though most likely not viewed.</p>
<p>Not all security cameras operate in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light abilities have a shutter that allows more light to go into the camera's sensor. The more light that is permitted to get in the camera the brighter the image will be. However, even these low light capable cameras have digital sound that make the dark image appearance fuzzy. To combat this fuzzy image some security cameras come geared up with 2D and 3D digital sound reduction Some security cameras now feature infrared light that is undetectable to the human eye but can be picked up by a security camera's sensor.</p>
