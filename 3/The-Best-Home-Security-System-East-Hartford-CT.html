<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, ought to offer at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending upon use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of totally free cloud storage (with more offered for a month-to-month fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will allow the camera to appropriately identify motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop.

If home security is your main concern, we 'd advise among our top choices, but the Arlo is terrific for checking in on family and pets-- or roaming felines slipping around your lawn.</p>
