<p>SimpliSafe's mobile and web app controls are also very basic, and do not have nearly the style or polish of some of its rivals. They do the job, however they won't win any awards for their eye sweet. And though SimpliSafe does support setting Nest thermostats to away modes when the alarm is set and integrates with August locks, its clever home combinations aren't almost as extensive as some of the other security systems I checked.</p>

<p>Carbon monoxide gas detection. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that can be hazardous to both animals and human beings.

With a wireless system, you can also get push notices on your phone or tablet that let you know there is a concern, even when you're not in your home.</p>
