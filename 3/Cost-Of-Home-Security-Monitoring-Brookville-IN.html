<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Basically, wireless security systems depend on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work using radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensing units, lights and other security equipment are all linked to one base station or panel to receive sensing units needed to control your equipment including enabling, disabling and sending you instant signals. Once a signal is gotten, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, web, email, or text portal.

The Area can tape-record as much as 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were often missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline.

Alarm system permits require a one-time registration fee of $45. There is no annual renewal fee and the authorization remains in place as long as the alarm system is in use at the same address.
