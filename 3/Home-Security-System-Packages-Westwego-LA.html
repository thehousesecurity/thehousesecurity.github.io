<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our screening-- during the day and during the night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the photo quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day.
