<p>Some wireless home security systems offer a video recording storage choice and others don't. For the ones that do not, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is recorded. The systems with video storage typically include either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage option saves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself. This choice is typically cost-free. A cloud storage alternative saves your video clips in the cloud. However, this is generally a paid service and the number of hours it will store will depend upon just how much cloud storage you want to pay for.</p>
