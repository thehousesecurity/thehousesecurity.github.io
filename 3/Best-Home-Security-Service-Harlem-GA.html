<h2>Home Surveillance Cameras Inside The Home Harlem</h2>
<p>We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for one of our top areas. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape as much as 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, however entries were frequently missing, despite appearing in the app's activity timeline. With standard clever home devices like automated door locks, you can remain in bed and inspect that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you keep an eye out for prospective plan thieves or talk to visitors who drop in.</p>

We think their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint. That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty busy with awesome clever home features. We particularly liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>
<p>In truth, federal government action was just recently taken against Vivint due to the fact that the company had problems with supposed misstatement of provided services and working with unlicensed company agents. On top of that, some customers encountered problems with service cancellation, installation of defective equipment, and extremely aggressive reps.
