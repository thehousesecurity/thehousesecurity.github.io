<p>The Hive View delivers fantastic 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to manually stop alerts (and recording, since it does that even when notifications are off).

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
