<h3>Wireless Home Burglar Alarm Systems Browns Mills NJ 08015</h3>
<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to ignore objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
