<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later developed to address the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily picked words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

To fight this fuzzy image some security cameras come equipped with 2D and 3D digital sound reduction Some security cameras now include infrared light that is invisible to the human eye but can be gotten by a security camera's sensor.</p>
