The subscription is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs whenever you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
