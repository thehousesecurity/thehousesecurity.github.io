<p>Cross-zoning is a technique that does not require a new keypad. Using several sensing units to monitor activity in one area, software application analyses input from all the sources. For example, if a motion detector trips in one area, the signal is taped and the central-station monitor informs the consumer. A second alarm signal-- gotten in a nearby zone within a brief time-- is the verification the central-station monitor needs to request a dispatch immediately. This builds in increased protection and a fail safe need to a door blow open or a bird rattle an exterior window.</p>
