<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services offering benefit, comfort and fulfillment to every client and are dedicated to satisfying our client's needs with integrity, honesty, interest and excellent service. Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, spanning a number of years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly evolved into the highly advanced yet budget friendly systems readily available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and see it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
<p>With a professionally monitored system, when a smoke or intrusion alarm is triggered, a representative will initially try to reach you through the two-way control board before calling your listed telephone number. The agent will call 911 to dispatch an emergency situation responder to your home if you stop working to react.
