<h3>Commercial Security Service Urbana IL 61801</h3>
<p>The price of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that high, even at $499, due to the fact that it consists of 3 outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month membership cost sounds pricey, but it's not a lot when you think about that a live human is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras detect suspicious activity. That person at Deep Guard's center can alert a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local police dispatcher if they decline to engage or leave in a criminal act. It's not for everybody, but it's the best DIY outdoor security camera we've seen to date.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
