We need to keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the picture quality based on offered bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest includes the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>

Promote the fact that your home or business is alarmed by using a warning decal.</p>
