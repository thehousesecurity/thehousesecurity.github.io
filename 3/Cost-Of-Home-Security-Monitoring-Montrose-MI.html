<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to neglect objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
