When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those people and will send smartphone alerts with that information when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV).

Follow installation and elimination directions to prevent any paint damage from the adhesive product. Nevertheless, this kind of security camera is still easy to hook up with only one power cable television to deal with compared with the standard analog cameras. Smart alarms are simply as reliable as standard alarm systems but they do not constantly have an external siren that rests on the front of your house, which can serve as a deterrent to robbers.
