<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends possible culprits are less most likely to dedicate criminal activity if they think they are being watched or have a greater risk of being nabbed. This is also called the rational option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime avoidance technique, which argues that opportunities to offend can be minimized by changing a variety of systems such as increasing the threat of a wrongdoer being collared, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, decreasing rewards from criminal offense commission, and lowering justifications that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the culprit should understand the included surveillance for it to attain its preferred result.</p>
