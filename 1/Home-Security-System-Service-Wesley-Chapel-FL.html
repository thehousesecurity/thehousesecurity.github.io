After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send mobile phone notifies with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers.

<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and again in client reviews, and it delivers a crisp image up to 32 feet. And despite the fact that the app and software application are easy to deal with, it's a little a letdown that you can't incorporate this camera with any clever home hubs or gadgets.

Tech is supposed to make our lives simpler and Hive's community lives up to that. It's all the function with no frustration.</p>
