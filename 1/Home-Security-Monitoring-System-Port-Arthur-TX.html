<p>Power-over-Ethernet switches use just to NVR systems, but they eliminated other components that would be required for a DVR system, like extra source of power and the BNC cables used to link cameras to the DVR. Rather, when you link a PoE switch to your network, you've got a power source and a means of transferring data to your NVR all in one package.

However these combinations aren't rather as robust as the residence or Ring systems.</p>
