Surveillance cameras are also produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some challenging consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
