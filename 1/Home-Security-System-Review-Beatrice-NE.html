<p>When it comes to home security systems, Houston locals have alternatives. You can choose a nationally acknowledged brand or go with a local company.

Due this spring, the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight is an outdoor camera combined with a 2,000-lumen light in a totally wire-free fixture. (You can pump that illuminate to 3,000 lumens by combining the battery with outdoor cabling).
