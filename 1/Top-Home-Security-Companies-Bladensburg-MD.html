"Once the criminal offense and offence figures were adjusted to take account of the general down trend in criminal activities and offenses," criminologists found in one research study, "reductions were kept in mind in particular classifications but there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had actually minimized criminal activity in general in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office also found that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the fear of criminal offense (as had a 2002 study, also for the British government).</p>
