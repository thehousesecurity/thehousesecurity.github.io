Outdoor cameras need to be weather condition resistant and in many cases, entirely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance rating are the most durable. Bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor alternatives due to the fact that their style permits minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is much better to have a camera geared up with infrared detection as opposed to motion detection. Because frequently times the motion detection is set off by motion such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will supply more accurate and less frequent alerts.</p>
