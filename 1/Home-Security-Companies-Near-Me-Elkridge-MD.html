<p>Arlo claims that you ought to be able to get four to 6 months out of a fully charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature. In long-lasting screening of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic location. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have actually not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that varied in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-term screening, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it required a full charge once a month.</p>
