<p>Noticeable and unpleasant wires running across walls and floorboards are an eyesore - no matter the situation. Luckily, security system manufacturers appear to have actually caught on to this issue and addressed it through wireless security cameras.

<h3>Home Security Systems Near Me in California</h3>

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
