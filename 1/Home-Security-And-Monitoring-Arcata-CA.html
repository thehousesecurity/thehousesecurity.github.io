<p>Studies show surveillance cameras reduce criminal offense. With its top-notch video quality, excellent motion detection, flexible scheduling and instinctive user interface, the Arlo Q would be a contender as our best home security camera even without its extremely generous basic cloud-subscription strategy, which offers you a week's worth of recordings free of charge. The square-shaped Arlo Q needs to be plugged into a power outlet and isn't water resistant, however it's the very best camera for monitoring the interior of your house or apartment.</p>

Wyze's recently introduced Complete Motion Capture fixes this issue for $1.50 each month per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly begins another, without any spaces in between. Recordings are easy to discover under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, however we do not suggest that for home security because if it's stolen, you don't have a backup.</p>
