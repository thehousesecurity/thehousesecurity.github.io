<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly common. If a property owner forgets their secrets and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by a community cat, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the essential action.</p>
