For a bigger surveillance variety, the system includes easy growth, accommodating as much as 8 cameras with an optional hard disk upgrade to 6TB.

Surveillance cameras are also made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some difficult repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always better.</p>
