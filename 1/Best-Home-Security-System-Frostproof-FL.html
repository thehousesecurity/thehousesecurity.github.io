In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with an offered video recorder prior to buying.</p>
