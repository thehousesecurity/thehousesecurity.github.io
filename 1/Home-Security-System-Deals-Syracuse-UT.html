<p>Seattle's main intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more accountable for incorrect alarms, and reduce the number of unnecessary cops and fire reactions. Alarm monitoring companies are the experts and need to be teaching their clients how to correctly set and care for their alarm systems.

Equipment works on the costly side, however Link rewards longer contracts with increasingly substantial discounts on equipment. Monitoring expenses $30.99-$ 44.99 month-to-month. I am really satisfied with this product! The cameras were much better than expected and I enjoy the benefit of being able to inspect it from my phone while I'm not home.</p>
