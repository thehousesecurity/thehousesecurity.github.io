They finish the job, but they will not win any awards for their eye candy. And though SimpliSafe does support setting Nest thermostats to away modes when the alarm is set and integrates with August locks, its clever home integrations aren't almost as substantial as some of the other security systems I evaluated.</p>

It likewise features 2 days of totally free cloud storage (with an option for more ), which can pack in clips of up to 3 minutes. Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips.
