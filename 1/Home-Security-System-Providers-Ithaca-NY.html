This means they typically over-expose what neighbors in a scene, causing people and items to appear burnt out" and without any information. A lot for trying to identify the bad people. Commercial cameras, however, frequently are geared up with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can adjust their brightness automatically to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear correctly exposed and in full detail. If a camera can not catch and provide a properly-exposed and sharp  image during the day and in the evening, it has limited effectiveness.</p>
