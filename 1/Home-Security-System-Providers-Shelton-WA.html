Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long method, covering several years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually progressed into the extremely advanced yet inexpensive systems offered today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and view it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>
