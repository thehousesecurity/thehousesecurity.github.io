<p>A taut wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to overlook things that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
