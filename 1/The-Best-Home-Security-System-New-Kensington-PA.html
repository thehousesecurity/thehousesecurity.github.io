Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.

Employing a specialist costs more, but for those who prefer to let an expert manage the job and don't mind spending the extra money, professional installation is the way to go.</p>
