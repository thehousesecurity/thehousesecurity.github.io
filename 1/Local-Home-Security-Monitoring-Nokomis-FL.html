<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
