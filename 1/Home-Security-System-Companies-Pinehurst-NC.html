<h3>Top Home Security Companies in North Carolina</h3>
<p>Some monitoring expenses in our table do not include things like mobile access, home automation, or camera monitoring. You might have to pay more for those functions. Vivint, Ring, Abode, Brinks, and Nest stick out here-- they give you mobile monitoring with any plan. With other companies, we think mobile access is worth the additional cost so you can sign in at any time and manage your system from anywhere.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
