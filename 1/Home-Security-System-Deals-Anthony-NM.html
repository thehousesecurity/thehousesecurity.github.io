<p>A tight wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to ignore items that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>

A self-monitored system gives property owners protection and assurance without the cost of a monitoring company.
