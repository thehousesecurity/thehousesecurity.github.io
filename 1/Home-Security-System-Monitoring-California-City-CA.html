<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, vandalism, and fraud. Meet our favorite solution for home monitoring and protection: the Piper nv Smart Home Security System with Night Vision and a 180-degree Video Camera. The only part of the Vivint experience that isn't automated is installation-- that's left to the company's considerate, educated experts. Our tester felt that the pro who installed his Vivint system was polite, timely, and truthful (even lowering his costs after understanding they didn't require to install one camera).</p>
<p>The big difference between wired and wireless systems is how signals are received. While wired systems depend on radio frequency, wireless security utilizes cellular signals. For a larger surveillance range, the system includes simple expansion, accommodating as much as eight cameras with an optional disk drive upgrade to 6TB.

Some clever alarms consist of or can be used with wifi security cameras from the exact same producer. Not only do these serve as motion sensing units but they allow you to see what's happening in your house if the alarm has actually been set off, so you'll know if it's an incorrect alarm or an authentic emergency situation.</p>
<p>However, convenience doesn't always include added security. Going from wired to wireless security means potentially exposing yourself to outside attacks if you do not do it right. You do not need to enter a house to cut the wire with wireless," the method you would with wired security, cautions Du. Without taking the appropriate security safety measures, you could be leaving your home available to intruders who can jam your system and enter your home without your sensing units picking up their existence.</p>
