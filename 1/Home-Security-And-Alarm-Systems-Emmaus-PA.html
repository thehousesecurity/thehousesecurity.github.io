<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
