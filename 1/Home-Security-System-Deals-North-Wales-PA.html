There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll require to understand whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder before purchasing.</p>
