<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a satisfaction to utilize also (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you want to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a learning curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's terrific, though. If you do not currently have an Arlo camera or more in place, you're going to need to install a center that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can mean there are variety concerns.</p>
