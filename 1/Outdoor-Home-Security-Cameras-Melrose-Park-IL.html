A team of three to 4 installers will require to install cameras, the system panel, and additional equipment (depending upon what's consisted of in each custom-made package).

<p>Capable of operating in both regular and poorly lit environments, these cameras benefit from not requiring integrated infrared illuminators as they can capture clear video images in the dark thanks to their additional delicate imaging chips. For this reason, these cameras are ideal for outdoor surveillance applications in which IR cameras are unable to work optimally.

<p>Everyone we dealt with at NSS were extremely valuable and accommodating. The services they provided were exactly what we desired, and they carried out with professionalism and skills. I'm not sure if any consumer-grade outdoor camera carries out all that well when it's foggy or raining, especially during the night when weather truly mess with the night vision. Still, you're best about the Arlo Pro not doing anything to keep rain from hitting the lens cover.</p>
<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on 2 AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it captures a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone notices and live views were painfully slow, and the variety is poor. Also, if the camera is in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
