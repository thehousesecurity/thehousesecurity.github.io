<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise great metal building and construction.
