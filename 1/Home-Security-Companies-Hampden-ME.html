With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
