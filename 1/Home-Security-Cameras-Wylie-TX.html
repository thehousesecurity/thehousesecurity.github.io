<h3>Home Security Companies in Texas</h3>
<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped case that the camera sits in. Whilst these are reasonably discreet CCTV cameras in look, this doesn't stop them from discouraging bad guys. Since the dome housing makes it really tough for people to see which direction the camera is pointing, this is.

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
