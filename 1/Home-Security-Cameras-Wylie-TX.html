<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped case that the camera sits in. Whilst these are reasonably discreet CCTV cameras in look, this doesn't stop them from discouraging bad guys.

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
