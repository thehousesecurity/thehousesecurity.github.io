Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes.

Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
