<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
