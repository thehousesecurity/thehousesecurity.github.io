<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a short description of how thermal cameras work: All items discharge infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy released by an object is referred to as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it discharges.
