<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
