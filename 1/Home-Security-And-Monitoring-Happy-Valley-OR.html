<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. When it detected any type of interference, SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration saying the system would signal users. The company likewise questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be a best storm of situations for somebody to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to replicate the concern.

What good is a surveillance camera that only works preferably in best conditions like brilliant sunlight? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in particular situations such as baby-sitter webcams or checking in on an animal, though when looking to gather evidence of a criminal activity they often come up short.</p>
