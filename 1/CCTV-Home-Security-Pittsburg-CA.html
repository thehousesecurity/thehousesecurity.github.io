<p>However for everyone who likes ADT, it appears like there's somebody who's had a terrible experience.

It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
