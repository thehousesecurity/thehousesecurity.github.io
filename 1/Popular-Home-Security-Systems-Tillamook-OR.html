<p>Despite having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and include another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension set, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 ends up being more pricey overall per system than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof solution.
