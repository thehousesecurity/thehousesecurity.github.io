<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>

<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
