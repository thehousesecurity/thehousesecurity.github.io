<p>Frontpoint provides five packages and 2 monitoring strategies: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester chose the Interactive strategy but ended up discontented with its lack of live video surveillance.

It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
