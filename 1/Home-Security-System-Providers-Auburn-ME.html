<p>Arlo claims that you should be able to get four to 6 months out of a completely charged battery, depending upon settings, use, and surrounding temperature. In long-term screening of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have actually not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-term screening, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good amount of weekly traffic.
