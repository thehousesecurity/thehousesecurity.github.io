<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you walk by.

<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends prospective transgressors are less likely to dedicate criminal offense if they think they are being viewed or have a higher risk of being nabbed. This is also known as the rational option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime avoidance method, which argues that chances to anger can be lowered by changing a range of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of a wrongdoer being nabbed, increasing the effort to devote the criminal activity, reducing benefits from criminal offense commission, and reducing justifications that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).
