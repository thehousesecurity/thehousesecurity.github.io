<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services providing convenience, comfort and satisfaction to every consumer and are devoted to satisfying our customer's requirements with integrity, honesty, interest and exceptional service. Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, covering a number of decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly progressed into the extremely advanced yet cost effective systems available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape-record video and watch it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>If you hold down the panic or smoke alarm buttons on the alarm system touchpad for 1 to 3 seconds, an alarm is transmitted to the ADT monitoring center, and emergency situation services are dispatched immediately. An alarm gotten in this way can not be canceled. A couple of years back, there were only a handful of security companies in the game. Now, there are lots. Homeowners picking a system should look for a trusted, respectable company. A number of the very best security companies have been in the home security business for years, long before the concept of self-monitored systems even existed. Reputable companies tend to have better equipment and customer support as well.</p>
