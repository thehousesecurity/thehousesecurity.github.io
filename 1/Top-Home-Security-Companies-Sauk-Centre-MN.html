<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
<p>Some wireless home security systems offer a video recording storage choice and others don't. For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is taped. The systems with video storage usually consist of either a local storage or cloud storage option. A local storage option saves a pre-determined number of video clips on the gadget itself. This alternative is generally cost-free. A cloud storage option saves your video clips in the cloud. However, this is normally a paid service and the variety of hours it will keep will depend upon just how much cloud storage you are willing to pay for.</p>
