An alarm user shall preserve at each alarm system website, a set of written operating instructions for each alarm system. (Ord. 2002-28 § 1, 2002). The drawback to monitored systems is the cost.

<p>The NVR removes these problems, because it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
