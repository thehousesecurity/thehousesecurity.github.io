<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
