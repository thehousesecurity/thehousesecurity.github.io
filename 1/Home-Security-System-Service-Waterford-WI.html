<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, accommodating advanced smart home connoisseurs or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, including creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. But the Secure is costly, additional sensors are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of emergency alarm or camera backups-- is likewise pricey if you do not devote to a three-year agreement.</p>
