<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
