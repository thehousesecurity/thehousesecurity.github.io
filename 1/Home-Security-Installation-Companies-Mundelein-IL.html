<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
