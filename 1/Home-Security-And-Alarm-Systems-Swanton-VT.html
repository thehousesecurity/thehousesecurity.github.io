<h3>Security Cameras For Your Home in Swanton VT</h3>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording footage in the dark is a priority.</p>

Wired systems require professional installation, and you can't easily add equipment or move it around. You're connected by wires. Wireless systems use a liberty that wired systems can not.</p>
