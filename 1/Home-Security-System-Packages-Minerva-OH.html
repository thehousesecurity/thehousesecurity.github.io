<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can determine individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send out mobile phone informs with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION).
