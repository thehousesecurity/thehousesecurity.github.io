<p>Do you own your alarm equipment? Another reason to read your existing alarm contract carefully.

Just another sneaky method to keep highly successful accounts.</p>

<p>The rate of admission for the Deep Guard Home Security system isn't that high, even at $499, due to the fact that it includes 3 outdoor cameras with two-way audio.

That person at Deep Sentinel's facility can caution a suspicious individual that they're being observed, and they can call your local police dispatcher if they decline to engage or leave in a criminal act.

<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, dealing with innovative smart home aficionados or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I tested, including creative things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. But the Secure is expensive, additional sensing units are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of fire alarms or camera backups-- is also pricey if you do not dedicate to a three-year agreement.</p>
