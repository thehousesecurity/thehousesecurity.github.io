<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
