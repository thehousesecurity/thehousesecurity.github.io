<p>Everyone we dealt with at NSS were really valuable and accommodating. The services they offered were precisely what we desired, and they performed with professionalism and skills. I'm not sure if any consumer-grade outdoor camera performs all that well when it's foggy or raining, especially in the evening when weather really mess with the night vision.

In Britain, where cameras have actually been thoroughly deployed in public locations, sociologists studying the issue have found that they have not decreased crime. "Once the criminal offense and offense figures were gotten used to take account of the basic down pattern in criminal activities and offenses," criminologists found in one study, "reductions were kept in mind in specific categories however there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had minimized criminal offense in general in the city centre."
