<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
