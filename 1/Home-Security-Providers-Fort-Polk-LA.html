<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests potential offenders are less likely to dedicate criminal offense if they think they are being enjoyed or have a greater risk of being apprehended. This is also referred to as the rational choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity prevention technique, which argues that chances to anger can be decreased by modifying a variety of systems such as increasing the threat of a wrongdoer being nabbed, increasing the effort to commit the criminal offense, reducing rewards from criminal activity commission, and reducing justifications that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).

In other words, NVR records higher-quality video and allows for systems to be scaled up a lot more easily than can be made with DVR.
