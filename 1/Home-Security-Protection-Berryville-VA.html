The Angee is short on functions and big on operating costs. The Ooma Butterfleye has no night vision and has bad daytime video; the Reolink C1 Pro frequently showed green and pink lines throughout the screen; the Yi Dome Camera continuously flickered at night; and the Samsung SmartCam had bad audio and a complicated app.</p>
