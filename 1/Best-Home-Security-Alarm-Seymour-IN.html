<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter occasion notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you stroll by.

A 2nd alarm signal-- gotten in an adjacent zone within a brief time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor requires to ask for a dispatch immediately. This builds in increased protection and a stop working safe should a door blow open or a bird rattle an exterior window.</p>
