<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively typical.

With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. False alarms happen.
