Figure 1-1 depicts an example of a CCTV installation that keeps an eye on select locations of protection. The first installation was designed and established for the separate parking facility. This application consisted of a number of set position cameras on each floor of the parking lot, stairwells, and exits, all linked directly to a primary control system (PCU) for management of each video stream. The PCU is a basic device for managing the input and output of video feeds through the coax cable televisions. Secondary energies and devices can supply easy combination of some alarms, but this technology has actually restricted capabilities and an intricate integration procedure.</p>
