<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a property owner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is activated by a community cat, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be called by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
