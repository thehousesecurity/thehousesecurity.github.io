<p>We didn't consider alarm that required professional installation. Pro-installed systems usually cost more, usage equipment comparable to that of DIY systems, come with generally burdensome and long agreements, and typically depend on the same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they use little benefit. A fine example is the Vivint system, which we've examined independently and don't advise for many people.</p>

It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare individuals and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
