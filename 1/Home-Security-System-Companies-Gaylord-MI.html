Although it does not have the largest operating temperature range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the couple of cameras on our list that included a genuinely weatherproof cable and plug.

Nevertheless, this is normally a paid service and the variety of hours it will keep will depend upon just how much cloud storage you want to pay for.</p>
