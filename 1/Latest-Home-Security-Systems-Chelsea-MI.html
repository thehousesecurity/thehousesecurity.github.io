Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals each time you stroll by.
