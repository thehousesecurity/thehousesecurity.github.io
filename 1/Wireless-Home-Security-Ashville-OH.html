<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter occasion notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic areas.

<p>I" m not satisfied with this item. It requires an addition hard disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is good. The motion sensing units work well.
