Conditions such as outdoor or indoor area and the existence or absence of light will play a huge role in choosing which camera is best fit for the task at hand. Numerous other models were disqualified due to performance issues. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, frequently buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of up to 90 seconds between videos.</p>

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest).
