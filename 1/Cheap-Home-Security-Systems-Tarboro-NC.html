<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
