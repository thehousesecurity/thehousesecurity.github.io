<p>I discussed that all we would require to do is take advantage of any among the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends out double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the risk and, if required, might simply push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
<p>Surveillance systems present police "bad apples" with a tempting chance for criminal misuse.

Picture what someone like that could do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>
