In long-term testing of the camera, we typically got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic location. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have actually not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that fluctuated in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent.
