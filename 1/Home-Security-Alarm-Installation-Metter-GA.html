<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based on our testing, must provide at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending upon usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of totally free cloud storage (with more available for a month-to-month cost ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will permit the camera to appropriately identify motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That also conserves battery life, but it might leave you with tape-recording gaps during crucial security events. If home security is your main issue, we 'd recommend one of our top picks, but the Arlo is great for checking in on household and pets-- or roaming cats slipping around your yard.</p>
