<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you pay for". The majority of wireless home security systems are DIY and easy to link using 'how-to' videos or the provider's handbook. Although you won't have an expert install your security equipment, you'll conserve money from installation expenses. And when you're ready to move, just evacuate your equipment and reinstall it without untangling wires or setting up a specialist. In the London train bombings in 2005, terrorists brought bombs onto trains and buses, detonating them during rush hour. After the terrible attacks, cops reviewed CCTV camera footage and saw the terrorists entering the train station, bring backpacks packed with dynamites. The terrorists were recorded on several CCTV cameras, but sadly they were neither noticed nor intercepted before they were able to carry out the attacks.</p>
<p>It's disappointing that the Yi Outdoor Camera doesn't have the people signals that are on the company's indoor camera, given that those could truly reduce notifications of bugs and cars and truck lights. Audio was also choppy, and the operating temperature level of 5 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit will not work for colder climates. Yale is associated with home security and the yellow siren boxes are a big turn-off for would-be burglars. In the past you 'd require deep pockets to have a Yale system professionally installed (and after that monitored for an additional cost) but the Smart Living range is Do It Yourself, wireless and app-controlled.</p>
