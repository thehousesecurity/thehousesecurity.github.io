<p>This system employs an electro-magnetic field disruption principle based on two unshielded (or 'leaky') coax cables buried approximately 30 cm (1 feet) deep and 1 m (10 feet) apart. 6 The transmitter emits continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable television and the energy is gotten by the other cable. When the modification in field strength compromises due to the presence of an object and reaches a pre-set lower limit, an alarm condition is generated. The system is concealed after installation.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal considering that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
